- ‚öôÔ∏è I work primarily in `Python` (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, etc.) and `SQL`, but I have enjoyed working with a number of languages and in a number of systems/platforms, including Docker and IBM's Services.
  - Nothing takes too long to learn; new languages are only a few dedicated days of study away 
- üåç I'm currently applying for full-time positions, primarily looking for data science/ML engineer roles but open to anything challenging and/or impactful
- üíÖ Individual repositories hold the major work (coursework and personal projects) I've done to date.  The primary ones are pinned, but I've listed my favorite here:
